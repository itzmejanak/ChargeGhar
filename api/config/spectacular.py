"""
DRF Spectacular OpenAPI Configuration
======================================

This configuration lets DRF Spectacular auto-discover all endpoints from URL routing.
We use @extend_schema decorators in views to provide metadata (operation_id, tags, descriptions).

No manual endpoint filtering or collision fixes needed - the framework handles it automatically.
