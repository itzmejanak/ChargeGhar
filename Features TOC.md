# **üîã Charging Station Backend (Django DRF) ‚Äì Technical Specification**

We are building a shared charging station network for Nepal using physical kiosks placed in high-traffic areas like malls, restaurants, and public spaces.

Our system allows users to rent a power bank by scanning a QR code on the station using a mobile app. The power bank can be used on the go and returned to any station in the network, making it convenient and flexible.

The hardware is sourced from Besiter, a trusted manufacturer of smart charging solutions. We are customizing the system for the Nepali market ‚Äî from local language support to Nepali payment gateways like eSewa, Khalti, stripe.

This is a smart, scalable, and user-friendly ecosystem that solves the everyday problem of dead phone batteries, empowering people to stay connected across cities in Nepal.

# üí≥ Payment Features

## Purpose
Wallet management, transactions, and payment gateways for both pre-payment and post-payment models. Users can pay with points only, wallet only, or points first + wallet for remainder. All payment decisions are driven by the single `/calculate-options` endpoint using the `scenario` flag.

## Payment Endpoints

| Feature | Endpoint | Method | Description |
|---------|----------|--------|-------------|
| User History | `/api/user/transactions` | GET | Lists all wallet transactions (top-ups, rentals, fines). |
| Get Packages | `/api/payment/packages` | GET | Lists rental packages with prices and types. |
| Get Payment Methods | `/api/payment/methods` | GET | Returns active payment gateways (Khalti, eSewa, Stripe) with min/max limits. |
| Create Top-up Intent | `/api/payment/wallet/topup-intent` | POST | Creates a payment intent for wallet top-up. Returns payment URL & `intent_id`. |
| Verify Top-up | `/api/payment/verify-topup` | POST | Validates top-up payment status with gateway and updates wallet balance. |
| Calculate Payment Options | `/api/payment/calculate-options` | POST | Single endpoint for all scenarios: `wallet_topup`, `pre_payment`, `post_payment`. Returns sufficiency flag, shortfall, and breakdown (points + wallet). |
| Pay Rental Due | `/api/rentals/{id}/pay-due` | POST | Pays outstanding rental dues using the same body as `/calculate-options`. Unblocks account. |
| Payment Status | `/api/payment/status/{intent_id}` | GET | Returns status of any payment intent: `pending`, `success`, `failed`. |
| Cancel Payment | `/api/payment/cancel/{intent_id}` | POST | Cancels a pending top-up intent. |
| Start Rental | `/api/rentals/start` | POST | Creates rental session. Pre-payment: call after `/calculate-options` shows sufficient funds. Post-payment: call immediately after package selection. |
| Request Refund | `/api/payment/refund/{transaction_id}` | POST | User-initiated refund for failed transactions. |
| List Refunds | `/api/payment/refunds` | GET | Lists all refund requests for the user. |
| Webhook (Khalti) | `/api/payment/webhook/khalti` | POST | Receives Khalti callbacks. |

| Pending Refunds | `/api/admin/refunds/pending` | GET | Admin-only: lists pending refund requests. |
| Approve Refund | `/api/admin/refunds/{id}/approve` | POST | Admin-only: approves a refund. |

## Payment Flow

### 1. Wallet Top-up Flow
1. Select package ‚Üí `GET /api/payment/packages`
2. Select payment methods ‚Üí `GET /api/payment/methods`
3. Pay and update wallet:
   - `POST /api/payment/wallet/topup-intent`
   - `POST /api/payment/verify-topup`

### 2. Pre-payment Rental Flow
1. User scans QR code of station (gets station SN)
2. Show packages ‚Üí `GET /api/payment/packages`
3. Calculate options ‚Üí `POST /api/payment/calculate-options`
4. If sufficient balance (points, wallet, or combination):
   - Start rental ‚Üí `POST /api/rentals/start`
5. If insufficient balance:
   - Redirect to wallet top-up flow (1.3)
   - After completion, call start rental ‚Üí `POST /api/rentals/start`

### 3. Post-payment Rental Flow
#### 3.1 Before Rental
1. User scans QR code of station (gets station SN)
2. Show packages ‚Üí `GET /api/payment/packages`
3. Start rental ‚Üí `POST /api/rentals/start`

#### 3.2 After Rental
1. Calculate options ‚Üí `POST /api/payment/calculate-options`
2. If sufficient balance (points, wallet, or combination):
   - Clear dues ‚Üí `POST /api/rentals/{id}/pay-due`
   - Update user in DB
3. If insufficient balance:
   - Redirect to wallet top-up flow (1.3)
   - After completion, clear dues ‚Üí `POST /api/rentals/{id}/pay-due`
   - Update user in DB

### PayDue Flow
1. Calculate options ‚Üí `POST /api/payment/calculate-options`
2. If sufficient balance (points, wallet, or combination):
   - Clear dues ‚Üí `POST /api/rentals/{id}/pay-due`
   - Update user in DB
3. If insufficient balance:
   - Redirect to wallet top-up flow (1.3)
   - After completion, clear dues ‚Üí `POST /api/rentals/{id}/pay-due`
   - Update user in DB

> **Note:** The `calculate-options` endpoint includes a body parameter to identify each scenario.

## Important Notes

- **One decision endpoint**: `/calculate-options` drives wallet top-up, pre-payment, and post-payment dues
- **Payment priority**: Points first, then wallet
- **Insufficient funds**: App redirects user to top-up flow and retries `/rentals/start` or `/pay-due`
- **Webhooks & status polling**: Keep existing implementation intact
- **Wallet Balance**: Stored as a `DecimalField` (NPR)
- **Transaction Status**: `pending`, `success`, `failed`, `refunded`
- **Pre-payment**: User pays before rental starts. Late returns incur overdue charges
- **Post-payment**: User pays after return based on actual usage. Accounts are blocked if dues not cleared
- **Strict validation**: Block new rentals until all dues are cleared for post-payment model
- **Payment Intents**: Use intent-based system for better tracking and idempotency

## **‚úÖ Final Notes**
- **Device Communication**: Uses **Alibaba IoT ‚Üí MNS ‚Üí Django Celery** for hardware events.
- **Authentication**: **JWT** for user sessions.
- **Background Tasks**: **Celery, Redis, RabbitMq** for OTP, notifications, and async processes.
- **Database**: **PostgreSQL** for data integrity.
- High priority features (User features, App Features, payments features [wallet, points], notification features, renting features, station features, Admin features, Points & Referral Features)
- Low priority features (**Content Management**, **Social Features**, **Promotion Features**)
- In listing endpoints use proper and logical and best suite case filter params according to our project scope to fetch data and proper pagination

> Note High priority features will be focused more and low priority features kept minimal but logical and helpful
