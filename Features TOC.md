# **üîã Charging Station Backend (Django DRF) ‚Äì Technical Specification**

We are building a shared charging station network for Nepal using physical kiosks placed in high-traffic areas like malls, restaurants, and public spaces.

Our system allows users to rent a power bank by scanning a QR code on the station using a mobile app. The power bank can be used on the go and returned to any station in the network, making it convenient and flexible.

The hardware is sourced from Besiter, a trusted manufacturer of smart charging solutions. We are customizing the system for the Nepali market ‚Äî from local language support to Nepali payment gateways like eSewa, Khalti, stripe.

This is a smart, scalable, and user-friendly ecosystem that solves the everyday problem of dead phone batteries, empowering people to stay connected across cities in Nepal.

## **‚úÖ Final Notes**
- **Device Communication**: Uses **Alibaba IoT ‚Üí MNS ‚Üí Django Celery** for hardware events.
- **Authentication**: **JWT** for user sessions.
- **Background Tasks**: **Celery + Redis** for OTP, notifications, and async processes.
- **Database**: **PostgreSQL** for data integrity.
- High priority features (User features, App Features, payments features [wallet, points], notification features, renting features, station features, Admin features, Points & Referral Features)
- Low priority features (**Content Management**, **Social Features**, **Promotion Features**)
- In listing endpoints use proper and logical and best suite case filter params according to our project scope to fetch data and proper pagination

> Note High priority features will be focused more and low priority features kept minimal but logical and helpful
