# 🔋 Charging Station Backend - Development Tracking

## Project Architecture Analysis

### Current State
- ✅ Well-structured Django project with app separation
- ✅ Comprehensive models across all apps
- ✅ Celery configuration ready
- ✅ Base models with UUID and timestamps
- ❌ Minimal serializers (need complete implementation)
- ❌ No task definitions (need Celery tasks)
- ❌ No service layer architecture

### Proposed Architecture Pattern

#### 1. **Layered Architecture with Service Pattern**
```
Views (API Layer) → Services (Business Logic) → Models (Data Layer)
                 ↓
              Tasks (Async Processing)
```

#### 2. **Code Organization Strategy**
- **Serializers**: Input/Output validation and transformation
- **Services**: Business logic, cross-app operations, complex workflows
- **Tasks**: Async operations (notifications, points, external APIs)
- **Utils**: Shared utilities and helpers
- **Permissions**: Custom permission classes

#### 3. **Shared Components Structure**
```

├── common/
│   ├── services/          # Shared business logic
│   ├── tasks/            # Shared async tasks
│   ├── utils/            # Utility functions
│   ├── permissions/      # Custom permissions
│   └── exceptions/       # Custom exceptions
└── [app]/
    ├── serializers.py    # App-specific serializers
    ├── services.py       # App-specific business logic
    ├── tasks.py          # App-specific async tasks
    └── views.py          # API endpoints
```

## App Development Checklist Template

For each app:
- [ ] Analyze existing models
- [ ] Create comprehensive serializers
- [ ] Create service layer
- [ ] Create async tasks
- [ ] Create custom permissions (if needed)
- [ ] Update views to use services
- [ ] Add proper error handling
- [ ] Add logging
- [ ] Add tests (unit tests for services)

## Key Design Principles

### 1. **Separation of Concerns**
- Views: Handle HTTP requests/responses only
- Services: Contain all business logic
- Tasks: Handle async operations
- Models: Data representation only

### 2. **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**
- Shared services for common operations
- Base classes for similar functionality
- Utility functions for repeated code

### 3. **Scalability**
- Service layer allows easy testing
- Task queue for heavy operations
- Proper caching strategies
- Database optimization

### 4. **Security**
- Input validation in serializers
- Permission checks in views
- Audit logging for sensitive operations
- Rate limiting for APIs

## Technology Stack Integration

### Celery + Redis + RabbitMQ
- **Redis**: Result backend, caching
- **RabbitMQ**: Message broker for reliability
- **Celery**: Async task processing

### Task Categories
1. **Notification Tasks**: FCM, SMS, Email
2. **Points Tasks**: Award points, referral processing
3. **Payment Tasks**: Gateway webhooks, transaction processing
4. **Analytics Tasks**: Usage statistics, reporting
5. **Maintenance Tasks**: Cleanup, health checks

## Next Steps
1. Set up foundation (common services, tasks, utils)
2. Start with Users app (highest priority)
3. Implement one app completely before moving to next
4. Test each component thoroughly
5. Document API endpoints as we build
