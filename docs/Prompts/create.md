# Create New Endpoint Prompt

I need to implement a new endpoint for the ChargeGhar PowerBank rental platform.

**What I need**: [Brief description - e.g., "Users report damaged powerbanks" or "Admin manages station maintenance"]

**App**: [users/stations/rentals/payments/admin/etc.]

**Implementation Instructions**:
- Follow the complete 6-step flow from `docs/CODE_GUIDE.md`
- Use proper error handling from `docs/ERROR_HANDLING_GUIDE.md`
- Analyze existing similar endpoints in the codebase for patterns
- Implement production-ready code with logging, validation, and documentation

Please create the complete endpoint following our established architecture.
